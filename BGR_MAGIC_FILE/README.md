# Mixed Signal SoC

Mixed signal SoC is a chip which contains both analog and digital blocks. The designers are adding more analog circuitry and increasing their complexities day by day. Not only that, they also contain digital control logic. As the process nodes shrink, the demand for integration grows. A divide and conquer approach is followed, where the analog and digital structures were dealt with separately. Usually, an analog IP (Intellectual Property) is bought as black- box. 

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/mixed_signal_soc.JPG">


# RTL2GDS flow of mixed signal SoC

To implement a RTL-to-GDS flow for mixed signal SoC, there is need to establish communication between the analog and digital blocks. For this integration to happen, hierarchical level of abstraction with either analog or digital as top level is required. In order to carry out this task, OpenROAD project can be utilized. 

# The OpenROAD Project

In order to carry out this task, OpenROAD project can be utilized. OpenROAD, is a ‘no human in loop’ hardware compiler which translates source code (RTL) to layouts (GDS). The time required for the translation is less than 24 hours. It is a DARPA initiative, an open source project. RTL2GDS flow of OpenROAD is used only for digital SoC. Hence, with OpenROAD, we can establish digital as our top level hierarchy

For more details visit [The OpenROAD Project](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project)

# OpenROAD tools installation

For detailed installation steps, go to [Steps to install OpenROAD tools.pdf](Steps%20to%20install%20OpenROAD%20tools.pdf)

# Inputs required for physical design

The main inputs required to carry out RTL2GDS flow are:
- LIB file
- LEF file
- top level verilog file

# Obtaining IP
The analog multiplexer for OSU018 is available on the following github page: [https://github.com/prithivjp/avsdmux2x1_3v3](https://github.com/prithivjp/avsdmux2x1_3v3)
This page includes the spice files and magic layout files. The magic file can be seen [here] (https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/IP%20Layout/21muxlayout.mag)

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/21muxlayout.png">

From this, build a layout using sky130.tech using the Magic Layout Tool. The modified layout can he seen [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/IP%20Layout/AMUX2_3V.mag)

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/AMUX2_3V.png">


## Tips for IP design using sky130 technology
- According to the height of the macro, the number of supply nets (power and ground) must be changed. For example, for dual height macro, there must be 3 supply nets( VDD-VSS-VDD). This is because it would be placed between standard cells and the power and ground net connectivity would be lost.
- The supply nets must be horizontal for them to fit into the rails.
- The size of the supply nets are fixed as shown below. The dimensions must be followed. 

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/power%20dimensions.JPG">

- The top level cell does not include the whole layout. 
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/macro%20height.JPG">


# Obtaining verilog files
The verilog file for analog multiplexer can be procured from [Efabless PicoRV-32 Github page](https://github.com/efabless/raven-picorv32/blob/master/verilog/AMUX2_3V.v)

To get the repository:
```javascript 
git clone https://github.com/efabless/raven-picorv32.git
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/amux.JPG">

# Getting LEF file

The LEF file can be obtained from magic layout synthesis tool from mag file . 


The IP uses sky130 as the technology node. So it is essential that the tech file for sky130 is downloaded in the machine. The tech file is present in this repository as [sky130.tech](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/sky130A.tech).

From the terminal type the following :

```javascript 

magic -T `/sky130A.tech ~/AMUX2_3V.mag
```


A layout window and a tkcon window will open. In the tkcon window, type the following command to dump out the LEF file

```javascript 
lef write AMUX2_3V.lef
```

# Limitations of current IP layouts
On opening the LEF file, it is observed that it is incomplete. The file does not contain the pin descriptions. 
On observing the layout from the layout window, we can see that the pins are not present. Only labels are present in the layout. And the magic tool is not able to identify these labels. 
Some fields which must be present in a LEF file appear to be missing.

This incomplete LEF file would not be accepted by the PnR tools.


# Resolving the pin issue
To convert the labels into pins, a command called `port` can be used in magic.

## For the labels on metal layers:
- Select the area under which the label is present. 

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/vdd_select.png">

- In the tkcon window type 
  ```javascript 
  port make
  ```
  To verify if the port is made 
    ```javascript 
    port name
    ```
 <img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/port.png">   

- Similarly, carry out the same process for other labels

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/tkcon%20window.png">

## For the labels on polysilicon layers:

- Type `g` to enable the grid option
- delete the label on `poly` layer by selecting the area where label is present and typing the following in tkcon window
   ```javascript 
  erase labels
  ```
- Connect a `polycont` layer on the `poly` on one side
- To the `polycont`, connect a `locali` layer . 
- Remove DRC errors if any.
- Create a label on `locali` layer , by selecting a point on the layer and in tkcon window, typing
  ```javascript 
  label 'name_of_label'
  ```
- Continue the same process for turning a label into port as mentioned above.

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/select%20zoomed.png">

Now, dump out the LEF file again by using 
```javascript 
lef write AMUX2_3V.lef
```
All the pins and their descriptions can now be seen.

A section called `OBS` must also be seen at the end of the file. If it is not visible, it means that the label on polysilicon is not converted into port properly.

# Other important fields of LEF file
In addition to converting pins from labels, there are certain other lines included in the LEF file, such that it can be accepted by the openlane tool:
- ` CLASS CORE`

This line can be added using the following command in the tkcon window:
```javascript 
 property LEFclass CORE
```
- ` ORIGIN 0.000 0.000 `

The layout must start from the origin (0,0)
In order to get this: 
1. first find out the current co-ordinates of origin by:
selecting the whole layout and type the following in tkcon window
```javascript 
box
```
From this, llx and lly are X and Y co-ordinates respectively.

2. setting X co-ordinate to 0:
```javascript 
move origin right 'llx' um
```
3. setting Y co-ordinate to 0:
```javascript 
move origin bottom -`lly`um
```
4. checking if the origin has shifted to (0,0):
first find out the current co-ordinates of origin by:
```javascript 
box
```
Now, the llx and lly should have the value of 0.

- `SITE unithddbl`

To set this, type the following from tkcon window:
```javascript 
 property LEFsite unithddbl
```
- `SIZE`

The height of the macro must be either 2.72 um or 5.444 um in order to fit into the rails ( for fd_sc_hd) . In order to acheive this, change the dimensions of layout in magic. 

<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/macro%20height.JPG">

This can be achieved by fixing a bounding box of 5.44 um.
```javascript 
property FIXED_BBOX {0 24 874 568}
```

- `DIRECTION`

Select the part which contains the pin and type the following in tkcon window:
1. For Power and Ground pins:
```javascript 
port class inout
```

2. For Input pins:
```javascript 
port class input
```

3. For Output pins:
```javascript 
port class output
```

- `USE`

Select the part which contains the pin and type the following in tkcon window:
1. Power pin:
```javascript 
port use power
```

2. Ground pin:
```javascript 
port use ground
```

3. Other pins:
```javascript 
port use signal
```
	  
- Ultimately, after configuring all the lines for LEF, create a LEF file by typing the following in tkcon window:
```javascript 
lef write AMUX2_3V.lef
```

# Writing LIB file
LIB file can be got by using a perl script, which converts verilog file to LIB file. The script is taken from the website [VLSI Professional Network](https://vlsi.pro/creating-lib-file-from-verilog/).
To view the script, go to `verilog_to_lib.pl`

The verilog file is obtained from the efabless github page. But, the names of the pins defined in the verilog file and the layout and LEF file obtained above may be different. 
Therefore, change the pin names in the verilog file accordingly and then obtain the LIB file by using the perl script by typing the following on terminal

```javascript 
perl verilog_to_lib.pl AMUX2_3V AMUX2_3V
```

The modified verilog file and the LIB file can be viewed from [AMUX2_3V.v](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/Verilog/AMUX2_3V.v) and [AMUX2_3V.lib](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/LIB/AMUX2_3V.lib) directory. 

# Verilog files
- The top level verilog file [design_mux.v](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/Verilog/design_mux.v) contains instantiation of the AMUX2_3V macro and other circuitry.
- [AMUX2_3V.v]((https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/Verilog/AMUX2_3V.v) is the verilog file for AMUX2_3V macro.
- [raven_spi.v](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/Verilog/raven_spi.v) and [spi_slave.v](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/Verilog/spi_slave.v) are the files to be included for the design. They can be obtained from [this](https://github.com/kunalg123/icc2_workshop_collaterals) repository 

# Experiments with Openlane and sky130

OpenLANE is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. It can be used for PNR on sky130 PDK. 

## Installation
Openlane along with sky130 PDK can be downloaded and installed by following the steps in [this](https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script) repository. 

## Adding a new project 
In the `designs` directory create a folder with the name of the project
```javascript 
 cd designs
 mkdir design_mux
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/design_mux.JPG">

## setting up the new project
To set-up the project, run the following :
Go to the `~/openlane_working_dir/openlane` and execute the following:
```javascript 
export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks reside>
```
```javascript 
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc2
```
```javascript 
 ./flow.tcl -design design_mux -init_design_config
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/bash%20shell.png">
This will create `config.tcl` file with default settings. The final `config.tcl` file can be seen from [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/openlane/config.tcl). This file also contains the reasons for some configurations as comments.

The information about configuration veriables can be found [here](https://github.com/efabless/openlane/blob/master/configuration/README.md)

## Adding input files

### Verilog files
The input files are to added under `~/designs/design_mux/src` directory. 
The `src`folder consists of verilog files for the design which may be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/verilog) 

- `design_mux.v` is the name of the top level verilog file.
- `AMUX2_3V.v` is the verilog file of the macro. 
- `raven_spi.v` and `spi_slave.v` are the files to be included in the design.

### LEFs
LEF file obtained must be included in `~/designs/design_mux/src/lef` directory

# The flow

To harden a macro, the automated flow for Openlane cannot by used. Instead an interactive script should be used. 

Go to the `~/openlane_working_dir/openlane` and execute the following:
```javascript 
export PDK_ROOT=<absolute path to where skywater-pdk and open_pdks reside>
```
```javascript 
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) openlane:rc2
```
A bash window will open. In the bash window, the interactive flow is executed.
```javascript 
 ./flow.tcl -design design_mux -interactive
```

### Setting up flow

The commands to be executed are also present in a script [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/blob/master/openlane/script.tcl):
```javascript 
package require openlane 0.9
```
```javascript 
prep -design design_mux -overwrite
```
### The LEF file for macro
```javascript 
set lefs 	 [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/lef/*.lef]
```
```javascript 
add_lefs -src $lefs
```
### Synthesis

```javascript 
run_synthesis
```
The output files can be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/synthesis)
### Floorplanning

```javascript 
init_floorplan_or
```
After floorplanning, the layout can be viewed in magic using the merged LEF and DEF file produced. The DEF file can be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/floorplan)
```javascript 
magic -T ~/sky130A.tech lef read ~/merged.lef def read design_mux.floorplan.def
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/floorplan.JPG">

### IO Placement

```javascript 
place_io
```

### Placement

```javascript 
global_placement_or
```
```javascript 
detailed_placement
```
```javascript 
tap_decap_or
```
```javascript 
detailed_placement
```
After final placement, the layout can be viewed in magic using merged LEF and DEF file. The DEF file can be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/placement)

```javascript 
magic -T ~/sky130A.tech lef read ~/merged.lef def read design_mux.placement.def
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/placement.JPG">

### Generation of Power Delivery Network(PDN)

```javascript 
gen_pdn
```

### Routing

```javascript 
run_routing
```
After routing, the layout can be viewed in magic using merged LEF and DEF file. The DEF file can be found 
[here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/routing)

```javascript 
magic -T ~/sky130A.tech lef read ~/merged.lef def read design_mux.def
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/routing.JPG">

### DRC Cleaning

```javascript 
run_magic_drc
```

The output file can be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/DRC)

```javascript 
magic -T ~/sky130A.tech design_mux.drc.mag
```
### Final Layout generation

```javascript 
run_magic
```

The final layout output is in the form of `design_mux.mag`. The files can be found [here](https://github.com/praharshapm/vsdmixedsignalflow/tree/master/openlane/results/Layout)
```javascript 
magic -T ~/sky130A.tech design_mux.mag
```
<img align="center" width="500"  src="/images/layout%20final.JPG">

## Notes and Tips
- You may have to update RePlace to the latest version if you wish to run placement for low instance count designs.
- If, the error still persists in placement, check if following block of code in `~scripts/openroad/or_replace.tcl` is commented. If not, comment it. 
```javascript 
global_placement \
 	-density $::env(PL_TARGET_DENSITY) \
 	-verbose 3
```
- The verilog files must not contain the power and ground pins. 
- Add the macro LEF both in the `config.tcl` file and in the interactive flow.
# Future Work
- To include custom LIB for macro and include timing constraints.
- To perform PNR on macro of triple-height or more
